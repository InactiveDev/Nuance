NuanceOS is my first project written in C and assembly.
I will develop it until version 1.0 and update it frequently.
In the files, I have provided detailed instructions on how to open it and install all necessary dependencies.
Under the **code** tag, you'll find the folder with NuanceOS source files, and under the **Releases** tag,
there are three binary files: `NuanceBootloader.asm`, `NuanceKernel.asm`, and `Nuance.img`. 
Starting from version 0.3, I will begin publishing ISO files for booting, and from version 0.5
onwards, I will rewrite the kernel from assembly to C.
